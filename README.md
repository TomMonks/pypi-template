## What is pip?

A package management system for installing python packages from the Python package index (PyPi - pronouced Pie Pie).  Example useage:

`pip install numpy`

or

`pip install numpy==1.18.0`

## Why use PyPi for your own projects?

It may be overkill, but its useful if you want to use a package in multiple projects without including the full source code.  

The obvious use if you want others to be able to easily install and use your software/project in their own work.  I use it for educational software for students at the moment.  Its something they can use after they leave as well.
